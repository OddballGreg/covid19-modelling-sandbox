# Covid19 Modelling Sandbox

## Why?
I am quite concerned about the worlds state and where COVID-19 may be going and where it may leave us in the future. As such I'm curious about applying my coding abilities to the problem to see if there's anything I may be able to contribute to help reduce the impact this virus has on everyone.

## Disclaimer
I'm not an epidemiologist, and odds are good I'm not a great mathematician either. Assume nothing I've done here is right unless someone far more experienced in such matters can confirm so.
